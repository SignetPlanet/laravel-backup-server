In order to use Laravel Backup Server, you must buy a license. You can buy at license at [our store](https://spatie.be/products).

Licenses are valid for the installation of Laravel Backup Server in a single Laravel app. A licence comes with one year of upgrades. If a license expires, you are still allowed to use Laravel Backup Server, but you won't get any updates anymore.
