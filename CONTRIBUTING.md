### 🧡 How We Work Together

**Start a conversation**

- **Have an idea?** We’d love to hear it! Open a discussion to chat about your proposal. Explain why it matters, and we’ll brainstorm together.

**Keep it simple**
- **Small fixes?** Jump right in! Fork the repo, make your changes, and send a pull request.
- **Bigger changes?** Let’s discuss it first in a discussion to align our ideas.

**We’re here to help!**  
Stuck? Confused? Ask questions in the issue tracker—no judgment, just good vibes.

### ✨ Our Shared Values

**Code with kindness**
- Write code that’s easy for humans to read (not just computers!).
- Keep methods short and focused—like a good coffee break.
- Add comments where things get tricky.

**Tests are friends!**
- If you’re adding something new, include a test to keep things safe and sound.
- We use [PEST](https://pestphp.com/) because it’s delightful. 🐝

**Documentation matters**
- Update the README if your change affects how folks use the package.
- Pretend you’re explaining it to a friend over tea. ☕
